# Blockchain-Voting-System
A voting system designed using the blockchain. Proof of Concept (PoC)
Blockchain ledgers would ensure that votes are secure and unable to be tampered with. In addition, they can easily be validated. 

# How does the application work?
The user can go to a specialized website (or in person if required by state) and fill out a digital form. (This site can be tailored to specific candidates) 

Once the user submits their vote, which includes the userâ€™s name, age, email address and other information. We can distinguish between unique users via a social security number or in our test case, a Google ID. 

The submission is then sent to be validated by the miners. Upon submission, the user will be greeted with something which shows the blockchain in its entirety. This allows for transparency. After mining, the vote is verified and counted!
